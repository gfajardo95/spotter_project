<h1>Spotter</h1>
A web app to plan your workouts.
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>To create a workout the first thing a user must do is sign in, or create 
an account. Then any workout routine will be saved with the associated user 
so that the user can come back and continue editing.

A user can assign a certain number of sets and reps per exercise.
The exercises can be associated to a <b>workout.</b> This workout is what one 
would normally do in a day.

All the user's workouts can be viewed from the <b>Dashboard.</b> From there 
it's possible to:
<ul>
<li>edit workouts
<li>delete workouts
</ul>

To create a new workout, the user must go to the <b>Create Workout</b> page.

Later, it will be possible to track your progress throughout the weeks. 
Possibly with a line graph that shows the rise and fall of different stats 
like the amount of weight used for a certain workout or the rest time per 
exercise.</p>
